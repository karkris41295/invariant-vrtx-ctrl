# How to use these files

Paper available here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03920

In order to run the python scripts, it's necessary to have MPCTools (and all its dependencies) available here: https://bitbucket.org/rawlings-group/mpc-tools-casadi/src/master/

Some of the code also requires the multiprocessing toolbox to run multiple simulations in parallel.

Recommendation is to run the code cell by cell on an IDE like spyder. Several lines which are used are commented out (mostly plotting)
