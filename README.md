# How to use these files

Paper available here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03920

In order to run the python scripts, it's necessary to have MPCTools (and all it's dependencies) available here: https://bitbucket.org/rawlings-group/mpc-tools-casadi/src/master/

Some of the code also requires the multiprocessing toolbox to run multiple simulations in parallel.

Here's a short description of the code included in this repository - 

1) vrtx_mimo_mpc4.py - 
2) vrtx_fix_act.py -
3) vrtx_ctrlmix.py -
4) mix_fig.py -
5) control_law.py - 
6) fix_act_mv_inv.py -
